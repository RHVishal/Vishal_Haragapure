# Project Summary

## Overview
This repository represents a **personal embedded systems portfolio** created to demonstrate practical knowledge and hands-on experience in **AUTOSAR Classic and Adaptive platforms**, **FreeRTOS**, and **automotive embedded software development**.  
Due to intellectual property and confidentiality constraints, **no proprietary or organization-specific source code is included**.

The content focuses on **design approach, RTOS behavior analysis, test strategies, and system-level understanding**, which closely reflect real-world automotive embedded projects.

---

## Project Objectives
- Demonstrate strong understanding of **RTOS concepts**, including task scheduling, synchronization, and ISR interaction.
- Showcase experience with **AUTOSAR OS configuration and behavior** in Classic and Adaptive environments.
- Present a structured approach to **test planning, validation, and edge-case analysis**.
- Maintain professional documentation standards commonly used in **automotive software development**.

---

## Scope of Work
The repository includes:
- Conceptual **system and software architecture documentation**
- **RTOS usage models** and task interaction explanations
- **AUTOSAR OS and BSW configuration overviews**
- **Test plans, test trees, and validation scenarios** for RTOS and OS features
- Pseudocode and mock examples for **illustrative purposes only**

The work is intended to reflect **real project practices** while remaining **technology-focused and IP-safe**.

---

## Technologies & Concepts Covered
- Embedded C / C++
- FreeRTOS kernel APIs (Tasks, Semaphores, Mutexes, Queues)
- AUTOSAR Classic OS
- AUTOSAR Adaptive concepts
- RTOS scheduling and preemption
- ISR-to-task communication
- Automotive software testing and validation
- SIL-based development concepts

---

## Testing & Validation Approach
The testing strategy emphasizes:
- Functional and boundary-condition testing of RTOS APIs
- Scheduler behavior with different task priorities
- ISR and task context validation
- Error handling and edge-case analysis
- Documentation-driven validation (test plans and observations)

---

## Intended Audience
- Recruiters and hiring managers evaluating **embedded/automotive software skills**
- Engineers interested in **RTOS and AUTOSAR system design**
- Interviewers seeking discussion material for **real-time system behavior**

---

## Disclaimer
This repository does **not** contain proprietary source code, confidential data, or employer-owned intellectual property.  
All documentation, diagrams, and examples are created solely for **educational and portfolio demonstration purposes**.
